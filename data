# Data Availability & Expected Input

No patient-level data are included in this repository due to privacy restrictions.
This repository contains analysis code only.

## Expected input format

The analysis expects a local dataset with the following columns (exact names):

**Required columns (used in the current notebook):**
- `Preemptive vs. Therapeutic` — treatment group label (e.g., "preemptive" / "therapeutic" or 0/1; keep consistent)
- `DLI to FU` — time from DLI to last follow-up (numeric; use the same units throughout, e.g., months or years)
- `Death Status` — event indicator (`0` = censored, `1` = death)
- `Diagnosis` — disease label (e.g., AML, sAML, MDS, ALL)

**Optional columns (if you plan extended analyses):**
- `Age` — age at allo-HCT (years)
- `Sex` — **encoded numeric**: `0` = male (m), `1` = female (f)
- `Time_to_Relapse` — time from allo-HCT to relapse (years)
- `Days_from_Relapse_to_DLI` — days between relapse and first DLI
- `GvHD_grade` — grade of aGvHD/cGvHD

## File placement
Place your local file in the `/data` folder as `input_data.csv` or `input_data.xlsx`.

**Note:** All datasets must be fully anonymized before use with this code.
